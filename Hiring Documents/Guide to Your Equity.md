# Guide to Your Equity

There are currently **TBD** ordinary shares outstanding. 17,647,059 shares will be allotted. This is anticipated to be the only allottment until the next funding round. 

Lattice equity is issued at par value. 

**This guide is meant to help you understand the piece of Lattice that you’re going to own!** Its goal is to be more straightforward than the full Employee Share Incentive Plan and Award Agreement, which both go into the full legal details. You should consult a corporate lawyer if you have any questions about navigating your share options and before you make important decisions.

Owning shares in Lattice gives you a stake in our success. As Lattice grows and increases in value, you will own a piece of that growth and increased value. Lattice is pretty small today, but if things go well, your shares could be worth many times more. However, you are gambling with this portion of your compensation -- if Lattice decreases in value, then your options won’t be worth anything.

## Employee Share Options

At Lattice, we give equity grants in the form of Employee Share Options. It’s called an option because you have the *option* to buy Lattice shares later at the same price it was worth when the option was granted. So if a share of Lattice share is worth £1 today and we grow so it’s worth £20 in a few years, you’ll still be able to buy it for £1 (and then sell it immediately for a profit of £19).

The reason we give share options instead of straight shares is that it keeps you from being taxed on the shares until you actually use it.

If we gave you £10,000 worth of Lattice shares today, you would have to pay thousands of dollars in taxes this year. If we give you options for £10,000 worth of shares, you don’t have to pay any taxes until you exercise them (more on exercising later). For more information on employee share options see: https://www.gov.uk/tax-employee-share-schemes/employee-shareholder-shares. 

If you are under a contract of employment issued with more than £2,000 of shares you are classified as an 'Employee Shareholder'. Lattice, as your employer, must pay for an independent expert to give advice about the terms and effects of the employee shareholder agreement.

## Vesting

Instead of giving you all of your options on day one, you get them over time. This process is called vesting and different companies offer vesting schedules of different lengths. If you had a basic 2 year vesting period, you would own a quarter of your shares after 6 months, half of your shares after a year, and all of it after 2 years.

The industry standard right now is 4 years, but at Lattice, employees’ shres vests over 6 years. We offer much higher equity grants than the industry standard (about 2x in most cases), but it takes longer to earn them. This works out so that employees always come out ahead, even if they leave before their shares has fully vested, but helps us communicate that we’re looking for employees who want to build longer careers at Lattice.

Vesting happens on a monthly basis (so you vest 1/72 of your options each month), but many vesting schedules include a cliff.

A cliff is a period at the beginning of the vesting period where your equity does not vest monthly, but instead vests at the end. At most companies, including Lattice, this cliff happens at one year. This means that if you leave your job before you’ve worked for a whole year, none of your options will be vested. At the end of that year, you’ll vest the entire year’s worth of equity all at once. This helps keep the ownership of Lattice shares to folks who have worked at the company for a meaningful amount of time.

## Dilution

When Lattice raises money from outside investors, it needs to create new shares to sell those investors. You will own the same number of shares as you did before, but there will be more total shares of Lattice available, so you will own a smaller percent of the company -- this is called dilution.

If we get a fair valuation for the company, then the value of your options stay the same when we raise outside money because the company’s new valuation will be equal to the old value of the company + the new capital raised. For example, if Lattice is worth £20m and we raise £5m, we are now worth £25m. If you owned 5% of £20m before, you now own 4% of £25m (we sold 20% of the company, or, said differently, diluted you by 20%). The 5% stake was worth £1m before the fundraise and the 4% stake is now worth £1m.

You can also be diluted as we give equity to employees. Lattice gives share option grants to new employees out of an option pool, or a group of options that the Lattice board of directors creates all at once. This means that you will not be diluted each time we hire a new employee, but only when we need to create a new option pool. Lattice’s current option pool is intended to cover the first 10 hires (excluding the three founders) before it needs to be refreshed. For some high-level executive hires, the board might approve share option grants outside of the equity pool. In both cases, the hope is that employees add more value to the company than the equity they receive.

Investor dilution won’t affect the value of your shares, but the valuation that we raise money at definitely will. Valuations (how much a company is worth) in private markets are highly unpredictable and subjective -- a share of Lattice stock is worth whatever someone will pay for it. Competition between investors, general market performance, perceived future value, and our negotiation skills all play into that valuation and the value of your options will be affected by those forces.

## Exercising Your Options

"Exercising your options" means buying the shares guaranteed by your options. You pay the exercise price that was set when the options were first granted and you get share certificates back. You can only exercise shares that has vested, but you can do it at any time by filling out a form and paying the cash amount for the stock.

You will usually only want to exercise the shares when you have the opportunity to sell it for a higher price than you are buying it for or when it is expiring.

Your share options expire 10 years after they were issued. You have 7 years to exercise your options after you stop working at Lattice.

Traditionally, employers have made options expire quickly after employees stop working at the company because the company also has to pay tax on the options when they are non-qualified and considered income. However, this means that many cannot afford to exercise their options and so either a) leave the company and lose the equity they worked hard for or b) stay at the company until they can afford it (this situation is often referred to as "golden handcuffs"). At Lattice, we want our employees to keep the equity they earn, and we don't want to keep anyone working here if they're not happy, so we give employees the option to exercise their options up to 7 years after they leave Lattice.

However, there is a very significant increase in the tax burden of exercising options 90 days after leaving Lattice that we cannot control. This means that while you have more options regarding your equity, you will lose a significant amount of your options' value if you wait. In weighing your different options, you should consult a tax attorney to help decide what path makes the most sense for you.

## Exercise Prices and 409a Valuations

The exercise price is how much Lattice stock was worth when you received the share option grant. Figuring out the right number for this is important. Investors in Lattice get *Preference Shares* with some special privileges (more on that below) so we don’t want to use the same valuation they paid to price your ordinary shares.

The lower the exercise price for Ordinary Shares, the more money your options will earn you, so it’s in our best interest to make this price really low. We have to get a valuation of our shares annually by HMRC. 

## Taxes

**Tax law is complex and you should consult a tax attorney who is familiar with startup share options before making any decisions.**

Lattice would love to advise you on the tax implications of your share options. However, tax is a complex area and is dependent on your personal circumstances. As such we would suggest that you consult a tax advisor who is familiar with your personal affairs. 

## Share Classes

When Lattice raises outside capital, investors will buy a form of Preferred Shares that gives them special rights on top of their ownership of the business. Each subsequent round of funding will create a new class of stock with its own rights -- these are usually named by the rounds of funding (ex. Series A Preferred Shares, Series B Preferred Shares, etc.). Here are a few example rights that preferred shares may have.

**Board seats:** A class of Preferred Shares may elect, independent of the other shareholders, a certain number of board seats. For instance, the Series A Preferred Share holders may be able to elect one person to Lattice’s board of directors.

**Liquidation preferences:** In a liquidation event (Lattice is sold or goes public), investors with liquidation preferences get paid back first. These favor the investor and lower the value of the stock. They usually cascade from the later rounds backwards, and can be a multiple of the money raised. For instance, if our Series A investors invested £5m with a 2x liquidation preference and Lattice was bought, then £10m would go back to the Series A investors before anyone else got any money back. If Lattice was sold for £10m or less, that would mean that everyone with ordinary shares (founders and employees) would get nothing. If Lattice sold for £15m, then £5m would be distributed among the ordinary shareholders.

## Outstanding Convertible Notes

Lattice has raised £TBD to date, all as convertible notes.

A convertible note is a popular way for startups to raise money because it lets us delay picking a valuation for a company. Instead of selling equity for a fixed price, we borrow the money as debt. Then, next time we raise money, that debt converts to equity at a discount. The discount rewards the initial investors for investing in the company early, and usually comes in 2 forms: a discount and a cap.

The discount is a fixed percentage (20% for Lattice) that the investors will get when the debt is converted into equity. The cap is a maximum valuation that the first investors will have to pay for the shares.  The debt converts to shares at whichever is lower: 80% of the price of the next round or the valuation cap.

For Lattice’s fundraise:

£TBD will be raised on notes with a cap of £TBD

Anyone is always welcome to ask our CEO of any questions they have about their options, Lattice’s fundraising, or anything else related to equity at Lattice. However, everyone should also consult a lawyer before making important financial decisions, especially regarding their equity because there are complex legal and tax requirements that may apply.
